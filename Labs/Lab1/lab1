lab 1

Q1:
When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and
executes commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.

When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive
shell with the --login option, it first read and executes commands from the
file /etc/profile, if it exists. After reading that file, it looks for
~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and
executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.

Q2:
See vi_lab

Q3:
I see a long listing of the contents of my CS265 directory. Specifically, filenames (I have no folders yet), their permissions, last modified date/time and owner of file. funny and hello.bash are in this list of files.

Q4:
I would be giving myself read/write, giving group read, and giving world read permissions.

Q5:
I would be giving myself all permissions, giving group read/execute, and giving world read/execute permissions.

Q6:
Yes, I can read it.

Q7:
Yes again.

Q8:
Yes, it printed:
Hellooooo!  My name is jmh463.  Have a good break?

Q9:
Via either command:
chmod 700 hello.bash
or
chmod u+x hello.bash

Q10:
Saving changes in vim results in "E45: 'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)". Using ":wq!" saves my changes. File permissions remain unchanged.

Q14:
The first command is lexically sorted and the second one is numerically sorted.

Q15:
sort -nr itemList-2cols | head -n8
or
